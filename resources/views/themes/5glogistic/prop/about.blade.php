                    SpaceX proposed the Starlink
                    program in 2015 and launched the first batch of prototype satellites in 2018. The plan aims to
                    launch tens of thousands of small satellites into low-Earth orbit to build a huge constellation of
                    satellites to provide broadband Internet services around the

                    Starlink is a space service company SpaceX that provides high-speed Internet access services covering
                    the world through a group of low-Earth orbit satellites. As of July 23, 2022, Starlink services are
                    available in 36 countries and regions.

                <p>
                    SpaceX CEO Elon Musk announced in Seattle the launch of a space high-speed internet project: the
                    Starlink project.

                    Starlink is a constellation of low earth orbit satellites used in the field of communications. It is
                    planned to consist of 42,000 satellites, which can provide users with large-capacity, low-latency
                    satellite Internet services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SpaceX's efficiency of 50-60
                    satellites per launch since May 2019 has been maintained for almost a few months. As of October 14,
                    2022, 3,399 satellites have been launched, including 3,168 in-orbit satellites (2,700 in-orbit) .
                    services) , 231 pieces were scrapped. Its users currently primarily include most of North America,
                    Europe, parts of Latin America, and most of Australia.</p>

                <p><br></p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>
                    The existing in-orbit satellites of Starlink can provide global users with high-throughput and
                    low-latency satellite Internet services, which can be divided into four categories: home use,
                    business use, RV special use and navigation special use

                <p>
                    Although as the world's first
                    satellite Internet product, it is more avant-garde than the traditional fiber-optic Internet that
                    people are familiar with, but from the perspective of customer experience, there will be no obvious
                    difference.
                </p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>
                    Compared with traditional Internet services with a high market penetration rate, satellite Internet
                    charges are too high and uncompetitive; but in areas where traditional Internet is difficult to
                    reach, satellite Internet has obvious price advantages, which is mainly due to the characteristics
                    of global coverage of satellite Internet .
                </p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>
                    Since the satellite Internet is a specific application of satellite communication, the satellite
                    communication system uses the communication satellite transponder as a relay station to realize
                    signal transmission between the ground by transmitting or forwarding wireless signals. The reception
                    of ground signals does not rely on erection like the traditional Internet. A large number of
                    road-based equipment can be transferred, so it can provide services even in inaccessible areas such
                    as desert Gobi, polar regions and oceans
                </p>

                <p>
                    In terms of satellite launches, SpaceX's multi-satellite launch capability and single launch cost are
                    very competitive, which constitutes SpaceX's core competitiveness in the process of building
                    satellite Internet constellations
